	/// A JSTimer allows to schedule tasks (Poco::Util::TimerTask objects) for future execution
	/// in a background thread. Tasks may be scheduled for one-time execution,
	/// or for repeated execution at regular intervals.
	///
	/// The JSTimer object creates a thread that executes all scheduled tasks
	/// sequentially. Therefore, tasks should complete their work as quickly
	/// as possible, otherwise subsequent tasks may be delayed.
	///
	/// JSTimer is safe for multithreaded use - multiple threads can schedule
	/// new tasks simultaneously.
	///
	/// JSTimer is a slightly adapted version of the Poco::Util::Timer class for
	/// use with JSTimedExecutor.
