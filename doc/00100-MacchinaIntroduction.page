!!!Introduction

macchina.io EDGE is an open source software toolkit for quickly building
embedded applications for the Internet of Things that run on Linux-based
devices like the Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone or similar.
It implements a web-enabled, modular and extensible JavaScript
and C++ runtime environment and provides readily available, easy to use
building blocks that allow your application to talk to various sensors
and devices, as well as cloud services.

macchina.io EDGE combines the power of JavaScript for rapid application
development with the power and performance of native C++ code.
macchina.io EDGE is based on the POCO C++ Libraries and the V8 JavaScript
engine. A unique bridging system and a code generator make it easy to
consume C++ services from JavaScript, without the need to manually write
glue code.


!!!Overview

macchina.io EDGE has been built in a very modular and extensible way. Figure 1 shows
the system architecture of macchina.io EDGE, which is also reflected in the source code layout.

[[image:images/macchina_overview.png Figure 1: An overview of macchina.io EDGE]]

macchina.io EDGE is mostly implemented in C++. Although JavaScript plays a big role in
macchina.io EDGE as the primary language for application development, it is not used much
in the implementation of macchina.io EDGE itself, except for some parts of the web user
interface.


!!Platform

The foundation for macchina.io EDGE is what we call the "Platform". It
consists of the POCO C++ Libraries, the Remoting framework, the Open
Service Platform (OSP) and the JavaScript environment, based on the V8
JavaScript engine. The platform is very generic and not specific to
macchina.io EDGE. Although it has been optimized for use in Embedded Linux
systems, it can be used to build other kind of (server) applications as
well.


!POCO C++ Libraries

The [[http://pocoproject.org POCO C++ Libraries]] are modern, powerful open source
C++ class libraries and frameworks for building network- and internet-based applications
that run on desktop, server, mobile and embedded systems. They provide essential features
such as platform abstraction, multithreading, XML and JSON processing, filesystem access,
logging, stream, datagram and multicast sockets, HTTP server and client, SSL/TLS, etc.
Virtually everything implemented in macchina.io EDGE (except some integrated third-party open
source projects) is based on the POCO C++ Libraries.


!Open Service Platform

The Open Service Platform (OSP) enables the creation, deployment and
management of dynamically extensible, modular applications, based on a
powerful plug-in and services model. Applications built with OSP can be
extended, upgraded and managed even when deployed in the field.

[[image:images/macchina_osp_overview.png Figure 2: Open Service Platform Overview]]

At the core of OSP lies a powerful software component (plug-in) and
services model based on the concept of bundles. A bundle is a deployable
entity, consisting of both executable code (shared libraries or
JavaScript) and the required configuration, data and resource files
(e.g., HTML documents, images, stylesheets required for a web site).
Bundles extend the functionality of an application by providing certain
services. A central Service Registry allows bundles to discover the
services provided by other bundles. Bundles can be installed, upgraded,
started, stopped or removed from an application (programmatically, or
using a web- or console based administration utility) without the need
to terminate and restart the application.

The Open Service Platform has been developed by Applied Informatics. It was
first released under a commercial license. For macchina.io EDGE, the core of
OSP has been released under an open source license. The full version of OSP
(including features such as a command shell framework, improved user authentication
and authorization including LDAP support, cryptographically signed bundles, etc.) is
available from Applied Informatics under a commercial license.


!Remoting

Remoting is a distributed objects and web services framework for C++.
With Remoting, building distributed applications, implementing
high-level object-based inter-process communication (IPC)/remote method
invocation (RMI) or web services based on the Simple Object Access
Protocol (SOAP) and the Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) becomes a
breeze. Making C++ objects available remotely over the network or
turning them into a web service is as easy as adding a few annotations
to a header file. The Remoting code generator does the rest. There is no
need to maintain a separate interface definition, using an awkward
interface definition language.

Remoting has been developed by Applied Informatics. Like OSP, it was
first released under a commercial license. For macchina.io EDGE, the core of
Remoting (core library, code generator and TCP transport) has been
released under an open source license. The full version of Remoting
(including support for SOAP and WSDL, as well as JSON-RPC) is available
from Applied Informatics under a commercial license.

In macchina.io EDGE, Remoting is used for the C++-to-JavaScript bridging
mechanism. It can also be used for efficient RPC-based inter-process
communication, using the TCP transport.


!JavaScript Environment

The JavaScript environment in macchina.io EDGE is based on the Google V8 engine.
V8 is the JavaScript engine used in the Google Chrome browser and
node.js, the well-known server-side JavaScript platform.

There are bindings that allow using certain features of the POCO C++ Libraries
in JavaScript code. Examples are database access (SQLite), HTTP(S) client,
access to application configuration and environment, OSP service registry, etc.

A generic C++-to-JavaScript bridging mechanism makes it possible to access C++ objects
from JavaScript code, without the need to manually write glue code.


!!IoT Components

The IoT Components are the "heart" of macchina.io EDGE. Various OSP bundles and services
implement features such as interfaces to devices and sensors, network protocols
such as MQTT or COAP, interfaces to cloud services (e.g., for sending SMS or
Twitter messages), and the web-based user interface of macchina.io EDGE.


!Devices and Sensors

macchina.io EDGE defines generic interfaces for various kinds of sensors and devices.
Based on these interfaces, different implementations are available that make
specific sensors and devices available in macchina.io EDGE. There are interfaces and
implementations for generic sensor types such as temperature or humidity sensors,
GNSS/GPS receivers, accelerometers, triggers, GPIO ports, serial port devices, etc.


!Protocols

macchina.io EDGE implements various protocols for talking to sensor networks,
automation systems, or cloud services. One such protocol is MQTT, a
publish-subscribe based "light weight" messaging protocol for use on top
of the TCP/IP protocol, which is popular for building cloud-connected
IoT applications. In macchina.io EDGE, MQTT is implemented using the
[[https://eclipse.org/paho/ Eclipse Paho]] C library.

Note: In the first release of macchina.io EDGE, only MQTT is implemented.
Future versions will implement additional protocols, such as
COAP or Modbus.


!Services

macchina.io EDGE implements services for publish-subscribe based
communication with browser-based applications using web sockets
(WebEvent), services for sending SMS and Twitter messages, which can be
used from both C++ and JavaScript code.


!Web User Interface

The user interface of macchina.io EDGE is entirely web-based. It is implemented
using the web server built into OSP. Parts of the web interface (e.g.,
System Information, Sensors and Devices, GNSS Tracking, MQTT Clients) are built entirely in JavaScript, both
on the client and on the server side. Other parts combine JavaScript on the
client side with C++ REST services on the server side.

The web user interface mostly uses jQuery and AngularJS. It is based on the concept
of "Apps". After logging in, the user sees a grid of app icons (e.g., "Bundles",
"Sensors & Devices", "Playground", etc.). Clicking an icon will "launch" the
respective app. New apps can be added to macchina.io EDGE simply by installing new
bundles. A highlight of the web user interface is the "Playground" app. It provides
a browser-based JavaScript editor and allows running JavaScript code on the
macchina.io EDGE server. The "Playground" app can also be used to create a new
JavaScript application bundle, which can be installed on a macchina.io EDGE device.
